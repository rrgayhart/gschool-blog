<h1> Title: Sinatra Applications </h1>

This week we've been working on two different Sinatra web applications - this represents the first time, other than creating a blog with middleman, that we've been creating something for the web. Obviously, the largest difference in doing this over doing command line projects is the complications involved with understanding routing. The secondary difference is probably formatting for views, but at least personally, I've had experience with static html pages so this isn't too challenging. 

Breaking out into the formatting for Sinatra made testing well-nigh impossible for a little while. The biggest compromise that I made coming into these projects from focus week was having to compromise on TDD. Currently with Idea Box, I have unit tests but have not yet been able to create an integration test (other than my own testing by staring at the results of pushing to  heroku, and running foreman and rackup).

I LOVE working on individual projects, and I think I made a great deal of progress with being able to work at my own speed. I had the good fortune of getting some help from teammates at crucial time s and then met with my mentor to review my testing strategy last night. She was able to explain exactly what I was testing and show me examples of capybara tests that she is currently fighting in her own work. I recognize that I learn different things from working in groups, but man, working alone is awesome.

That said, I was way more tired at the end of the day from having to keep on myself to tackle challenges. It was very easy to move away from something that was frustrating me. I found that during focus week, when I worked with @wvmitchell and @simontaranto, I had tons of extra 'brain power' at the end of the day because the flow of how we were working kept me from constantly second guessing if I was working on the right thing.

Next week is our first assessment, and the largest week point that I can think of is that I'm a little loose on completing assignments. For example, I am supposed to posting in our class blog and am instead posting in my actual blog. As far as strong points, I think I'm doing pretty well in utilizing the class resources. I've had a great and productive mentoring relationship so far and try not to either overload or underload the teachers with questions. I think I'm making progress in learning, although I'm not sure if that's self evident.

Here's to another week!
