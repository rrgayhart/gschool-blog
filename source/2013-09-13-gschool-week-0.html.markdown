<h1> Title: Exploring GSchool </h1>

<b>Things I've Learned</b>

* Programming is hard
* My classmates are uniformly pleasant and intelligent
* Past students of the program are enthusiastic about said program
* I need to cut down on my coffee consumption before I burst into flames

<b>Things I Want to Work on this Weekend</b>

* I'd like to browse some programming meetups in the area: Hoping to get some different perspectives and also find people to hike with - as it's intimidating to do so alone and will probably help me focus and stay enthusiastic.

* Look up Katrina Owen's refactoring talk(s) - I've heard from multiple sources, prior to GSchool that she is amazing. I would also like to know what flavor of kicking I will be getting later.
